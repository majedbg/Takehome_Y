Another advantage is, if you fix the eye, reading stops feeling like a task and your attention can go to your voice and pacing.
Another feature of this teleprompter is that it listens while you speak and tracks which word you are on in real time, so the display follows your speed, and if you go off script, it holds its position. When you come back and it picks up exactly where you left off.
Before any session, it also clocks your natural reading speed and uses it as a baseline. Punctuation introduces real pauses — a comma gets a beat, a period gets a breath. These are adjustable, because no two people phrase things the same way.
Built for people who care about how their words land.`;
